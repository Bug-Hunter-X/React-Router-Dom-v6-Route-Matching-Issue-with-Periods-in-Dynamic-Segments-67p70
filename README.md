This repository demonstrates a bug in React Router Dom v6 where routes with dynamic segments containing periods do not match correctly. The bug is caused by the period being interpreted as a path separator.  The solution involves using a regular expression to correctly match the dynamic segment.  This allows routes with periods in the dynamic segments to match correctly, resolving the issue.
