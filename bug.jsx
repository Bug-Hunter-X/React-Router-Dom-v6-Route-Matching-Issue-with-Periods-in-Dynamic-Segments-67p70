In React Router Dom v6, when navigating to a route with a dynamic segment that includes a period (.), the route may not match correctly.  For example, if you have a route like `/products/:productId` and try to navigate to `/products/abc.123`, the `productId` parameter might not be populated correctly or the route might not match at all. This is because the period is often treated as a path separator in some routing implementations.
